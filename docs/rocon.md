The following is a transcript of the video, compiled from the provided excerpts:

okay so Alex or Jordan who who am I today all right thank you all for coming uh great to see everybody here uh Houston uh how many of you have been to previous QSC's okay good a man so you guys have traveled uh I think we were in uh Orlando Las Vegas uh San Diego back in the day we used to be in uh San Francisco so uh thank you all for coming and uh as a thank you for all the efforts that you have taken to be here we have decided to uh eliminate risk for you so by by not hosting this conference in Las Vegas we have eliminated the risk of you losing money in gambling so that you can spend more money on college today all right so um let's talk about ASM to RSM um we're going to do some vibe rocking today whatever that means okay we're going to vibe rock um as you all a lot of you have been here 20 plus years we've been uh doing QSC very focused on um qualis qualis products vulnerability management uh we've been really innovating focusing on um you know continuing to to do better at detecting and finding more things and you know a few years ago I kind of realized that the better qualis got at detecting more things across more um types of assets the worse the situation was becoming for our customers because you know it just your stats now look even worse because you're fixing as a percent you're fixing less of what is being found because you're just finding more and so that started the journey a few years ago uh to uh start elevating uh the conversation of vulnerability management to more of an overall risk um conversation and that's where um QSC and moving QSC and overall what we do into a more of a risk operations approach was very important for us and that's why the great QAC is nothing what oh okay there you QC's rock on all right so uh the marketing team was uh you know taking a little bit of liberty and um creativity there with those curtains going back and forth um so the deck was uploaded this morning at 4:00 a.m by the marketing team so you and I are in this together we're just going to make up stuff as we go along with some of these slides as you can see um but uh you know I I have been at Qualis for uh 21 years I think or 23 I don't remember uh and back when I started uh just to kind of give you the journey of Qualis from uh the QSC to Rockan when I started people used to scan um our great customers to scan once a quarter their entire environment and by entire environment I mean like 5,000 servers and and Mario is is you know agreeing with me very vigorously he's been with the journey for with us for many years uh and then you would give the report and you would give your IT team 90 days to fix things you know because I guess attackers were not really taking it that seriously um and people would be like man wow like that customer scans every quarter like I wish I could do that so we have gone from that to when we release the agents we're scanning like every four hours now and giving you real-time up-to-date information and then some customers are coming back and saying like "Hey that's that's not fast enough like you should be checking every 45 minutes." And I'm thinking like how quickly are you fixing things cuz if you're not that's like you know you you weigh yourself four times a day but you don't go to the gym as you can tell from last QC to this QC I have applied 25 patches so that's been the journey that we have been on is how do we elevate the conversation from vulnerability detection to uh patch management now to overall uh risk management and uh rock on and really risk management when we talk about it is really a business conversation and so we it's it's been interesting last one year as we've been having this conversations half the folks are still like look my job is to scan like that's somebody else's job to patch and I'm sorry that's not the case anymore and we'll talk more about that so as you become and you know one of those videos talked about is at the end of the day cyber security is a **risk management exercise** to the company that's all we're doing is trying to manage risk from digital assets and every single person working in cyber security is a risk analyst and a risk operative and you're trying to do is reduce the risk. Risk management involves paying a certain amount of money to reduce the possibility of a certain amount of loss.

If you spend $50,000 to insure a car worth only $25,000, you are not managing risk correctly. This means involving the business, the CFO, and board members. CISOs often find board meetings challenging because talking about vulnerability counts, patches, ZTNA, MFA, or 2FA means nothing to the board. The board just wants to know if they are safer after spending $10 million.

Any risk management essentially has three components:
1.  How much you spend to **mitigate**.
2.  How much you **accept risk**. We are always accepting risk, whether by doing nothing or by delaying action.
3.  How you **transfer** the remainder of the risk (which you cannot mitigate or accept) to a cyber insurance company.

The conversation has evolved significantly since the speaker's first QSC talk, where the latest feature was the ability to pause a scan on Monday morning and resume it on Friday. Today, the conversations and panels include CFOs and CIOs discussing how they think about things, and there is a cyber insurance presence.

A hypothetical conversation illustrating budget challenges involves the CISO requesting a $2 million increase in the cyber budget, and the CFO asking if $100 million would make them fully safe. When the answer is "Of course not," the CFO suggests giving only $50,000.

The evolution to "Rockon" is important because there are few conferences focused on overall cyber risk management as it relates to business.

The focus needs to move from the **attack surface** to the **risk surface**. The speaker provided an example: if you spend $500,000 to protect an attack surface (a house with sophisticated security systems) but the risk surface (the valuable items inside) is only worth $50,000, the prioritization is wrong. Prioritization should focus on **what is at risk from a business value perspective**, not just the vulnerability priority or CVS score.

The expansion of the attack surface is due to the evolution of computing and digital transformation. The movement from on-premise to virtualization, and then to the cloud, accelerated rapidly. Early cloud adoption often involved "lift and shift," moving the "same old crap" from on-premise into the cloud, leading to the same issues.

Cloud-native companies, such as Uber, leveraged cloud capabilities to transform their business and disrupt competitors. A similar disruption is happening with AI, where old-school companies try to bolt on AI versus companies that are **AI native**.

The evolution of **agentic AI** this year has been a complete game-changer for both defenders and attackers. This is enabled by technologies like **MCP** (Management and Control Plane) servers/hosts. MCP allows companies to rapidly innovate and create capabilities using AI on top of existing infrastructure (API, application, database). MCP came out 6–9 months ago and is adopted almost everywhere, whereas RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) struggled for a couple of years.

However, MCP means that old systems (API, old database, end-of-life systems) are still present, requiring patching and fixing, and now organizations must also worry about MCP authentication and authorization. The volume of issues that must be dealt with is expanding exponentially, making it impossible to fix everything.

The second major trend is that the **time to exploit is compressing**. A Mandiant report indicated that the average time to exploit went from 63 days a couple of years ago to **minus one** day. Negative time to exploit means exploits are happening increasingly before patches are released. Attackers use tools like ChatGPT to find ways to exploit code before a patch is available. Low-skill actors are routinely leveraging extraction workflows using AI, contributing to the rise of "lazy criminals".

In a situation of high volume and short time, not every vulnerability matters to a breach or loss of business. Statistics show that less than 1% of vulnerabilities account for the majority of real-world breaches, a percentage likely to decrease further as the number of findings increases. What truly matters is the ability to fix the right things at the **speed of light**.

The concept of **risk arrival rate** (the rate at which findings are coming) versus **risk burndown rate** (the rate at which things are fixed) is critical. If the risk arrival rate is significantly greater than the risk burndown rate, it will be hard to keep up. The goal is to fix the right issue before an attacker exploits it. With AI, attackers are pointing it to open source code to find exploitable vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the only thing that matters is whether "we fix the right thing before an attacker tried to exploit".

While the attack surface and volume of risks are exploding, security budgets are not exploding at the same rate, nor are procurement approvals speeding up.

Since fixing everything is impossible, there is a need for **prioritization** and **super fast remediation** at the speed of AI. Attackers use AI to generate flawless phishing emails, sometimes requiring AI detection, as human capabilities are insufficient.

Cyber security is a **risk management function**. Risk management is defined as mapping issues to what will cause plausible loss and impact to the business. The focus should be on reducing the likelihood of a major financial issue.

When asking the finance team for an additional million dollars for cyber security (e.g., for ZTNA), they often see a "complete blank" on their face, as they don't understand or care. Finance teams may prefer giving that money to IT for a new AI capability that promises a 5% uplift on the top line, rather than to cyber security, which promises to make things "better" without quantifiable results.

To pivot the conversation, security teams should use **Value at Risk**. For example, a $500 million/year business might face a ransomware attack causing $10 million a day loss for up to 7 days. If the current risk is elevated (e.g., 70 out of 100 possibility of attack), fixing five critical things for $250,000 could bring the risk level down to the risk appetite (e.g., 400 from 700). The CFO then understands that $250,000 will reduce the possibility of a $10 million loss by 80%.

Wasting time asking the IT team to fix things that don't matter to the risk is essentially "stealing from the company" and taking away time they could use for innovation.

Risk factors are not just vulnerabilities. A machine might be fully patched but still have a C drive fully open read/write to the entire network, which is not a CVE but increases the chance of breach significantly. Risk must be looked at holistically. If a credential can be compromised, an attacker avoids hacking 10 different ports and lateral movement. True risk requires connecting factors, such as an Active Directory/Octa user with two-factor authentication disabled who logs into a device with a privilege escalation vulnerability.

The current state of posture management (XPM) is **"dashboard tourism,"** where teams build nice dashboards from multiple products but fail to fix anything meaningful because findings (like millions of CVEs from code scanners) cannot be explained in terms of business impact. Giving the IT team top 10 findings from 10 different products means they are fixing the top 100.

The industry must evolve into a process that **operationalizes overall risk management**. Reactive measures, like the massive effort spent fixing every instance of Log4j without determining if it was exploitable or caused risk, resulted in a "colossal waste of time and money".

Last year, the concept of a **Risk Operation Center (ROC)** was introduced. The **building blocks of any Risk Operations Center** start with a **unified asset inventory**. The Qualys platform has been opened up to ingest data from multiple different tools (like those addressing OT, IoT, etc.).

The ROC goes beyond mere aggregation of findings by adding:
1.  Business context.
2.  Quantification.
3.  Actual remediation.
4.  Compliance reporting and audit readiness.

Audit failure, which can be 100% within a team's capability to prevent, can stop a business from conducting operations (e.g., failing FedRAMP certification).

Current exposure management solutions often "overexpose everything," making everything look white, lacking clarity. Technical prioritization alone is insufficient. When presented with two business units, one with a 900 risk score (on a 1,000 scale) making $1 million/year, and another with a 750 score making $500 million/year, the prioritization should immediately switch to the $500 million unit. **Any prioritization without quantification is not really useful**.

Qualys ETM (Enterprise True Risk Management solution), the company's version of the Risk Operation Center in the cloud, enables full visibility. Risk management requires measuring, **communicating**, and eliminating risk. Communication is crucial. Instead of handing the IT team 10,000 CVEs and getting a frustrated response, a risk-quantified approach allows security to say: "Don't worry about those 10,000 things, here are 11 things; if you fix these 11 things, you will be the hero that brought down the risk of losing $10 million by 80%".

Communication to the board should focus on whether the cyber security spend is keeping the overall risk under an acceptable level (risk tolerance/appetite).

With ETM, communication is improved by moving away from vulnerability counts. Instead, the ROC enables communication in business terms, showing that, for example, 80% of the company's revenue has an overall risk score below the established risk appetite of 400.

**Elimination** of risk is the final component. Patching is operationally disruptive ("kind of violent"), and 10,000 CVEs might correspond to 1,000 patches, leading to 1,000 opportunities for operational issues. Prioritizing vulnerabilities that actually impact the business can reduce those 10,000 CVEs down to a much smaller list (e.g., 11 patches), balancing operational and security risk more meaningfully.

In a recent Proof of Concept (POC) conducted three weeks prior, Qualys pulled data from multiple tools (Qualys, Whiz, CrowdStrike, Defender, and external exposure management solutions):
1.  **Initial findings:** 62 million findings were aggregated.
2.  **Applying threat intelligence and context:** When the ROC applied threat intelligence and business context, only **2 million findings** had any possibility of potential compromise (e.g., being discussed on the dark web or having a proof-of-concept exploit).
3.  **Applying business context:** Applying context regarding internet-facing assets, revenue making, and key business units reduced the number to only **300,000**.
4.  **Validating compensating controls:** Checking for compensating controls (e.g., EDR installed) reduced the number even further.

A new capability is being announced that allows a **safe exploit quick** on internet-facing assets to confirm exploitability. By focusing remediation efforts, the spend on fixing vulnerabilities was theoretically reduced from $62 million to $150,000.

The 150,000 prioritized issues still need fast remediation. Qualys addresses this through a **remediation buffet**:
*   **Patching:** Qualys has installed **140 million patches** in customer environments in the last 12 months, demonstrating that IT and security teams are collaborating on cyber security-focused patching.
*   **Mitigation:** Quick, small mitigations can be applied based on threat intelligence (e.g., deleting an old DLL or changing file permissions) to prevent execution and exploit. This is especially useful when facing negative time to exploit (-1) and zero-days.
*   **Isolation:** Providing ways to isolate the machine.
*   **Uninstall:** Identifying and uninstalling software with exploitable vulnerabilities that has not been used for over a year.

This comprehensive approach is necessary because there is no single silver bullet for risk fixing. The elimination component should work without human intervention, or at least present the human with a safe, prioritized action plan.

Qualys emphasizes the **democratization of threat intel** and invests significantly in its own threat research.

To prioritize and fix issues at the speed necessary, **agentic AI** is leveraged for **human and AI collaboration**. The Risk Operations Center uses multiple AI capabilities across every stage to accelerate processes, such as handling Patch Tuesday. For example, simple business quantification is automated by an AI agent that looks at public filings to determine how much revenue each entity is generating.

The AI approach involves **named agents with profile persona skills**. For instance, **Agent Sarah** is an autonomous patch Tuesday life cycle agent. She can analyze the current situation, return with plans to reduce risk, and then execute tasks like creating an alert in Teams/Slack or pushing and verifying patch jobs. This paradigm shift allows teams to match the speed of attackers.

The goal is to **democratize access to all security data through a single view**, like a Qualys mobile app, so users don't have to log into 10 different dashboards. The future involves an enterprise AI engine where Qualys and other data are available through conversation rather than requiring multiple logins.

Qualys has also announced the idea of a **Managed Risk Operations Center (MROC)**. **MROC partners** help organizations leverage agentic AI, define business risk, tie assets together, monitor alerts, and take action.

For risk that cannot be mitigated or accepted, it is transferred to cyber insurance. Qualys announced a partnership with Malbury last year, offering a **15% discount on cyber insurance premium** if customers share the ROC high-level scoring (without sharing actual CVEs).

A demo showcased a fully agentic AI-driven ability to set up a Risk Operation Center's core components via conversation in under 10 minutes. Key agents demonstrated included:
*   **Agent SID:** An expert in looking at the external attack surface by analyzing the email domain and publicly available information to discover assets, estimate revenue, and map initial business entities.
*   **Business Entities Agents:** Helps organize business entities and map assets, including distinguishing between internet-facing and internal assets.
*   **Agent Tara:** An expert in configuring connectors for third-party tools like Qualys VM, CrowdStrike EDR, and Security Scorecard, allowing for conversational setup of data synchronization (e.g., daily incremental syncs).
*   **Risk Tuning Agent:** Allows tuning risk scores up or down based on business reality (e.g., increasing the score by 20% for publicly facing cloud buckets or decreasing risk by 20 points if MFA is enabled or EDR is running—a compensating control).
*   **Agent Quant:** Helps figure out financial risk based on insurance information and publicly available data for the relevant industry, including typical loss amounts.

The ROC can also show the **risk arrival rate** versus the **risk burndown rate** to determine if the organization is approaching disaster or maintaining equilibrium. For prioritization, agents can be asked to identify the most important things contributing to the risk being above the risk appetite. Mitigation strategy recommendations are provided, suggesting whether to patch, mitigate, or uninstall.

The **audit readiness agent** can look at mandates like **NIST**. Based on data from various tools (Qualys, Whiz, CrowdStrike), the agent can report audit readiness (e.g., 30% ready on technical controls). For procedural controls (non-technical controls like training programs or password policies), the agent leverages agentic AI and LLMs to process uploaded compliance documentation, helping automatically fill out evidence, potentially reaching 70% readiness.

In the end, the audience voted for the assistant's name to be **Rocky** rather than "Qualis Cyber Risk Assistant".

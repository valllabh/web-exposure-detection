# Sales Guide: Getting Seed Domains from Prospects

## What You Need

The main website domain your prospect uses. This lets us create their personalized AppEx report showing their web exposure.

## Before You Ask

**Heads up:** Our analysis visits their public websites to look for security signals. This is lightweight and non intrusive, but depending on how critical the deal is, you might want to give them a heads up or get their okay first.

## Who This Works Best For

**Great fit:**
- Companies running their own websites, apps, or APIs
- Businesses with customer portals or internal tools
- Any organization managing their own web presence

**Skip these:**
- MSSPs or security vendors (they typically have very less footprint and its not useful for them)
- Pure hosting or cloud providers

The best reports come from companies who actually own and run their applications.

## What to Ask

Simple question: **"What is your main company website domain?"**

**Most of the time, just one domain:**
```
acmecorp.com
```

**Only ask for multiple if they own separate companies:**

Think Broadcom after acquiring VMware. They need both:
```
broadcom.com
vmware.com
```

**Important:** Just ask for the main domain. Do not ask about subdomains like `portal.acmecorp.com` or `api.acmecorp.com`. Our tech automatically finds all of those.

## How to Send It

- Text file or email works fine
- One domain per line if sending multiple
- Domain name like `acmecorp.com` is perfect, but full URLs work too (we will clean them up)
